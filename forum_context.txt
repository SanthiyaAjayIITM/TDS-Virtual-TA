--- GA5 Clarification (Nov 2024) ---
anand_sir: You must use `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, even if AI Proxy doesn’t support it.
student1: So we should use OpenAI directly?
anand_sir: Yes, exactly.

--- Which subject to choose in jan term ---

21f3000745: Hii all…i know this may not be the correct platform to ask this question.<br>
Actually i have 3 diploma subjects to cover - MLP, JAVA, TDS. So which 2 subject should i choose for this term?
22f3002293: Don’t take TDS, this subject should be taken in the end else you might have some problem
carlton: TDS at the end best. Gives you the best chance of doing well in it.
Kind regards
Adityach1: Yes you should do tds after mlp only it really help you alot trust me

nilaychugh: how to get the dummy API key?
Jivraj: Hi Nilay,
In order to make a api call to openai chat completions you are required to send authentication information(openai key) in headers. For first question of GA3 you don’t have to send actual(working) api key, any dummy api key would work(you can put your name, or tds anything works)
kind regards

Jivraj: Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/22f3001315">@22f3001315</a> ,
You are almost correct, there are very minor changes that needs to be made.
Take help from Chat GPT or use this documentation which have correct json body <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Vision - OpenAI API</a>.
Kind regards<br>
Jivraj
22f3001315: it worked thanks sir
22f3002034: Are we supposed to buy open ai api key ?
23f2000237: No, if you scroll down to the last question, we can get our Ai Proxy key
carlton: <a class="mention" href="/u/nilaychugh">@nilaychugh</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/22f3002034">@22f3002034</a>
The API key is available at <a href="https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/</a>
The instructions on how to use the token is given at <a href="https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - sanand0/aiproxy: Authorizing proxy for LLMs</a>
You cannot use this token directly with Open AI or any other gpt. These are only valid via the API exposed by the above instructions.
You get a limit of $1. Use with care.
Kind regards
nilaychugh: but the embedding model that is said to be used is text embedding 3 small, which is the model of OpenAI
Jivraj: Hi Nilay,
Yes you would need to use <code>text-embedding-3-small</code> model of openai for embedding questions.
Kind regards<br>
Jivraj
nilaychugh: i have a doubt, while submitting the GA3, both 7th and 8th questions require the API url to be active and connected right, but its not possible as both the URLs use same port, so if we check my 7th question URL is running right now, it’ll show as correct, but then if i  run 8th question URL, the 7th question will automatically show the error, <strong>is there any solution to this problem?</strong>

You can run two servers on different port numbers.
Jivraj: Hi Vikash,
I looked at your answers in backend. In answer you submitted response from openai, but you need to submit json object which is required for sending a request to LLM.
Kind regards
Jivraj: You made same mistake here, instead of response use json body that’s required for sending request to LLM.

carlton: Your scores are evaluated on a site that is external to the seek portal and is not integrated with the seek portal. Therefore seek does not know if you have submitted or not and by default says that it has not been submitted because it cannot see your external evaluation. There will not be a fix for this for some time.
Scores for GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, Project1, Project2, ROE will NOT be inside your seek portal.
<strong>The scores will only be visible in the dashboard.</strong> Just ignore anything inside seek portal. The dashboard is where all your subject score cards exists.
As stated in multiple places on discourse as well as in live sessions, The final score is always your last submission. If your dashboard score does not match your final submission score on the assignment page, only then contact us regarding your marks.
Kind regards

The scores have not been pushed to the dashboard yet. Ignore seek portal. Seek portal will not have your submission or your scores because it is evaluated externally from the seek portal.

Dnyanu27: Only 1st Graded assignment scores are visible on dashboard.  I have submitted 2nd and 3rd GA before the deadline but still it showing “not submitted” on the seek portal…
21f3000697: I recently got mail and checked my marks for GA2 and noticed that the final score is showing as <strong>4.25</strong>, but while attempting the assignment earlier, I had scored <strong>7.25</strong> shown after submission.
Could you please help me understand how the marks were reduced? I want to ensure there was no error or misunderstanding in the evaluation.

The second email was an automated script that used a stricter criteria. You have passed evaluation and also have a score. So dont worry. We will push scores over this weekend. We are currently doing normalisation.

carlton: Hi,
Prerequisite checks have passed. But your docker image was missing a dependency that you forgot to copy into the image. so it failed to evaluate because it failed to run.

You have to replicate the test environment. If it works when you follow this test setup then you should get in touch with us.<aside class="quote quote-modified" data-post="316" data-topic="171141">

22f3002291: Please quickly arrange a live TDS session to explain this project. There are a lot of doubts and questions in our minds.
22f3002291: Please also give access to the answers for GAs. So that we can evaluate our api with the correct answers.
24f2003130: <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir, is there any bonus marks for code uniqueness and extra tasks like project 1
23f3001743: If we use ngrok to create a tunnel to our API or Llamafile server, for how long should our terminal remain running? Should it be active only at the time of submission, or must it be continuously available until evaluation is completed?
23f2000573: Is it like only the questions from the portal will be sent to the api?
If yes, is this project just about finding which question is asked and accordingly match the answer send the answer as response?

Hello Sir,
I understand that we can deploy on vercel. Can it be deployed on Heroku as well? I believe both serve the same purpose. Wanted to know your thoughts on the same sir.
Thanks and Regards<br>
Shalini
Jivraj: If you use ngrok, ensure that it is running continuously until you get your results
Jivraj: Any question from first 5 Ga’s can be there and you would need to analyze which question it is, you can use function calling or prompting as well. Function calling is better approach here.
Jivraj: Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/24f2006531">@24f2006531</a>
You can deploy it anywhere, just test how it works on Heroku, if it works(send request to api endpoint to your application and it should respond with answer)
Kind regards
22f3001315: will the asked question be same which was asked in my GAs (i mean there were variations in problem statements for diff-diff students.)<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a>  sir
Yogesh1: Was the variation because of the datasets? Or even the problem statement?
22f3001315: Mostly problem statement like different cities etc
Yogesh1: Then it comes down to what the project demands, as in what kind of questions the llm will be tested on (like you said). Hope the team can give us a test set like in the first project.
nilaychugh: my question is some graded assignments have image files as a answer, so should our api return files as the answer or like can you clarify what type of answers we need to work on?
23f2000237: I guess yes, our APIs should return photos if required

Keep posting your doubts here we will have answers to all of your doubts   In Thursday’s session.

All the image ids we evaluated were what <em>you</em> submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> as the official list that met all the pre-requisites of Project 1. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos <em>you</em> gave us.
For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.

23f2005702: How come me and my group used same code but some got 10 some 11 some 12?
Yogesh1: <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> Please make clear what the average marks are, what highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated.
We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.
carlton: You have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results.
22f3002933: I have noticed that my image was run on a <code>x86_64</code> architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is <code>ARM</code>. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the <code>exec format error</code>.
This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.
22f2001389: My evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it’s showing the server didn’t start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out. My roll no. is 22f2001389
carlton: We will check and rerun on arm if we ran it on the wrong emulation.
22f2001389: Any suggestions for my case sir ? I’m really tensed.

<a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a>  same issue, My image was also run on a <code>x86_64</code> architecture. I too built on my mac which is <code>ARM</code> (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the <code>exec format error</code>  and  <strong>Evaluation log file</strong> is MISSING.
Actually my image was run on x86_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.
I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

--- Bonus Marks in TDS for Jan 25 ---

23f2004636: <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> Greetings sir!<br>
Sir, I have a query about the criteria for earning bonus marks in the TDS course. I’ve noticed that some students who completed GA7 are receiving bonus marks for extra peer reviews (5 bonus marks is quite significant as it improves grades as well). However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?<br>
As the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us. Could you kindly clarify the situation?
Thank you and Regards<br>
Akshit
lakshaygarg654: Yes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses.<br>
However, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different.<br>
Is this information available to everyone <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir?
21f2000588: Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> sir,<br>
I hope you are doing well.
As per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7.
Now, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.
We sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.
Looking forward to your kind consideration.
Best regards,<br>

Harshjayswal-2003: <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> same happens for me also sir plz look into this matter.
23f2004912: <strong><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a></strong><br>
There seems to be a sudden and unannounced change in the GA marking scheme, which feels quite arbitrary. Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify.
Now I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.
I could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly.
<strong><a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a></strong>, we request you to kindly consider this matter. We are looking forward to a quick response — hopefully one that ensures fairness for all students.
vikramjncasr: <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir ,
This would be a deviation from the grading format right sir? As some of us were proactive and closed the 4 GA requirement earlier, if such extra weightage is given to a certain  GA unannounced then how is it fair on the other students ?<br>
Kindly consider
23f2004837: same for me also …<br>
Please consider all the GA for the calculation and give bonus based on the overall performance in GA’s instead of one GA.<br>
<a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a>
mahi.13: Exactly! This should have been informed beforehand.<br>
It’s really unfair
23f2004793: It the team wants to give bonus marks then why specifically to peer review week-7 ? Like all the GAs were equally important ! So please do something about this.
akashkunwar: <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a><br>
I have completed 5 GAs, but missed others due to the time commitment required, along with managing three other subjects and one project. I kindly request that 5 bonus marks be awarded to all, as the additional marks for GA were not communicated earlier. This could result in a disadvantage for those of us who were unaware of the extra marks for GA7. Thank you for considering this.
Regards:<br>
Akash
23f2004912: <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> I genuinely wish I could respond more humbly, but the way this has unfolded makes it hard — and sadly, I’m not MSD to handle it all with silence and a smile.
PalaashU: Good evening <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/jivraj">@Jivraj</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/saransh_saini">@Saransh_Saini</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/s.anand">@s.anand</a> Sir,<br>
I hope you are well
According to the grading document, we were told that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would count towards our final grade. There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn’t complete GA7.
Recently, we found out that some students received an email saying they’ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn’t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment.
We genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too.
Best regards,<br>

Yes sir , we have completed all the previous ga but not able to do week 7  , we feel that the bonus should be given to all on the basis of ga and not only on week 7 . Or it should have been informed earlier if such bonus was to be given . Please do consider our request . Thank you
23f1000598: Exactly , They have to informed this earlier , that week 7 have peer marks too , and now bonus too<br>
in the grading doc , they removed peer marks , so i thought it was removed , but its not

The sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators to offer clarification and ensure that all students are evaluated on an equal footing. We hope the final grading reflects both justice and academic integrity.

Yes Sir, I also completed 6 GAs even tho it was written only best 4 out of 7 GAs would be considered for final grade, but couldn’t complete GA 7 due to pressure of other subjects, if it was written in the grading document I would have done it, hoping you would understand Sir, Please do consider our request.<br>
Thank you
Namannn28: <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a> sir in the grading document it was mentioned best 4 out of 7 assignments but I did 6 GAs but skipped GA7 due to other assignments and projects but now we got to know that 5 bonus marks are given in ga 7 which seems unfair to all of us as mostly people who did GA7 are the one who were not able to complete previous GAs so giving bonus for the last day give them a edge
If it was announced before deadline of GA 7 it was okay and good for us to improve our grade but now it seems quite unfair so, please come with the best possible solution for this
Thanking you
waiting for your answer


--- Repeat course ---

Sagan: Even if I pass in end term TDS, Can I repeat the course in next term because I missed project1 and my CGPA will go down because of it?
This is my last term of diploma. So, can I take 1 diploma course and rest degree courses in next term?
lakshaygarg654: Yes, you can.<br>
More details given in student handbook. Search for repeat courses.

carlton: TDS is the worst subject to repeat in order to improve CGPA.
Its better to take a high credit, easy course to improve CGPA. <strong>We never recommend taking TDS for grade improvement.</strong> If you have passed it, its better to move on.
22f3000639: <a class="mention" href="/u/carlton">@carlton</a><br>
Sir, It is my humble request to kindly give atleast 2 bonus marks like any other subject, if i will get 2 marks as bonus my grade will stay good otherwise it will fall badly.
Sir plzzz it is my request.
carlton: Just as matter of interest, even on campus IITM MTech students take foundation Python course from BS Program to artificially improve their on campus CGPA (they take it as an elective).
So if the CGPA is that big a deal, do an easy 4 credit course and get an S. Dont repeat hard subjects, thats just a waste of time.
carlton: This is not up to us. We make adjustments within assignments and projects and we have done that already. For course level bonuses, that is the discretion of operations.
